## Share nothing architecture

A shared nothing architecture is a distributed computing architecture in which each update request is satisfied by a single node.
The intent is to eliminate contention among nodes, nodes do not share (independently access) the same memory or storage.
Easy to scale since multiple nodes can be added.
